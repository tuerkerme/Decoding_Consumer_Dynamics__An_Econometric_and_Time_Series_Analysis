## Decoding Consumer Dynamics: Advanced Econometric and Time Series Analysis of Bakery Transaction Data

## Analysis Steps

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 120,507 entries and 9 columns. The columns are:
1.	TransactionNo: Numerical identifier for each transaction.
2.	Items: Type of item purchased.
3.	DateTime: Date and time of the transaction.
4.	Daypart: Part of the day when the transaction occurred.
5.	DayType: Type of day (Weekend or Weekday).
6.	Payment Method: Method of payment used.
7.	Gender: Gender of the customer.
8.	Product Type: Type of product.
9.	Customer Age Group: Age group of the customer.

From the first few rows, we observe that some rows have missing values, particularly in the Daypart column. The DateTime column is in string format and will need to be converted to a datetime format for time series analysis.

### Data Cleaning
The next step will involve cleaning the data. This includes handling missing values, converting the DateTime column to a datetime format, and possibly creating additional time-related columns for detailed analysis. 
````
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = '/mnt/data/Bakery_Egin_Transactions.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display basic information about the dataset
dataset_overview = data.info()
first_few_rows = data.head()

dataset_overview, first_few_rows

```` 

The data cleaning process involved the following steps:
1.	Conversion of 'DateTime': The 'DateTime' column was converted to datetime format for accurate time series analysis.
2.	Missing Values: The dataset originally had some missing values across various columns. These rows with missing values have been removed for a cleaner dataset.
3.	Additional Time-Related Columns: New columns for 'Year', 'Month', 'Day', 'Hour', and 'Weekday' were added to facilitate more granular time series analysis.


### Descriptive Statistics

The next step is to generate descriptive statistics for the dataset. This will provide a summary of the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution, excluding NaN values. Let's proceed with this step. 
````
# Convert 'DateTime' to datetime format
data['DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['DateTime'], errors='coerce')

# Checking for missing values
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()

# Handling missing values
data_cleaned = data.dropna()

# Creating additional time-related columns
data_cleaned['Year'] = data_cleaned['DateTime'].dt.year
data_cleaned['Month'] = data_cleaned['DateTime'].dt.month
data_cleaned['Day'] = data_cleaned['DateTime'].dt.day
data_cleaned['Hour'] = data_cleaned['DateTime'].dt.hour
data_cleaned['Weekday'] = data_cleaned['DateTime'].dt.dayofweek  # Monday=0, Sunday=6

# Updated overview of the cleaned data
cleaned_dataset_overview = data_cleaned.info()
first_few_rows_cleaned = data_cleaned.head()
missing_values, cleaned_dataset_overview, first_few_rows_cleaned
````

Descriptive Statistics Overview

The descriptive statistics provide a comprehensive summary of the dataset:
1.	TransactionNo: The transaction numbers range from 1 to 90,000, with an average of about 37,542.
2.	Items: The most frequent item purchased is 'Soup', with 8 unique items in total.
3.	DateTime: The transactions are all from the year 2023, with dates ranging from January 1st to December 30th.
4.	Daypart: The most common time of day for transactions is 'Afternoon'.
5.	DayType: There are more transactions during the weekends.
6.	Payment Method: 'Mobile Payment' is the most used payment method.
7.	Gender: The most frequent gender category is 'Other'.
8.	Product Type: 'Food' is the most common product type.
9.	Customer Age Group: The most common age group is 'Adult'.
10.	Year, Month, Day, Hour, Weekday: These columns provide the distribution of transactions over time. The data is evenly distributed across months and days, with transactions occurring at all hours.

Time Series Plot: Daily Transactions Over Time

![Screenshot 2024-01-27 124403](https://github.com/tuerkerme/Decoding_Consumer_Dynamics__An_Econometric_and_Time_Series_Analysis/assets/149696414/280fc0c3-b5c6-4962-ba81-7ea0c1eda9c7)


The time series plot above illustrates the number of daily transactions throughout the year 2023. This visualization helps in identifying patterns, trends, and any cyclic behavior in the transaction data.

Observations:

•	There are noticeable fluctuations in the number of transactions per day.

•	Some days show significantly higher transaction volumes, which could be indicative of special events or promotions.

•	There is no immediately apparent long-term upward or downward trend, suggesting stable transaction volumes over the year.

### Seasonality and Trend Analysis

To further understand the time series data, we can decompose the series to analyze the trend and seasonality components. This will help in identifying any underlying patterns that are not immediately visible in the overall time series plot.

Decomposed Time Series: Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals
The time series data has been decomposed into three main components:

![Screenshot 2024-01-27 130429](https://github.com/tuerkerme/Decoding_Consumer_Dynamics__An_Econometric_and_Time_Series_Analysis/assets/149696414/42ec59f7-931c-4be8-9b5b-b4bd0652fc60)

1.	Trend Component:

•	This plot shows the long-term movement in the time series data.

•	It appears relatively stable throughout the year, suggesting a consistent level of transactions over time without a clear long-term upward or downward trend.

2.	Seasonal Component:

•	This plot highlights the repeating short-term cycle in the data.

•	There are regular patterns observable, which could be weekly or monthly cycles.

•	This seasonality might correspond to specific days of the week or months where transactions are consistently higher or lower.

3.	Residual Component:

•	This shows the randomness or irregularities left in the data after extracting the trend and seasonality.

•	These could be due to random variations or anomalies in the data.

Econometric Modeling

````
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
import numpy as np

# Checking for stationarity with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
adf_test_result = adfuller(daily_transactions)

# Preparing data for SARIMA model
# In case the data is not stationary, we'll take the first difference
if adf_test_result[1] > 0.05:  # p-value > 0.05 indicates non-stationarity
    daily_transactions_diff = daily_transactions.diff().dropna()
else:
    daily_transactions_diff = daily_transactions

# Splitting data into train and test sets
train_data = daily_transactions_diff[:int(0.8*len(daily_transactions_diff))]
test_data = daily_transactions_diff[int(0.8*len(daily_transactions_diff)):]

# SARIMA Model - The model parameters (p, d, q) and seasonal parameters (P, D, Q, S) would ideally be determined
# through model selection processes like grid search, but for simplicity, we'll use common parameters.
model = SARIMAX(train_data, order=(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 30))
model_fit = model.fit(disp=False)

# Predictions
predictions = model_fit.get_forecast(steps=len(test_data))
predictions_ci = predictions.conf_int()

# Plotting actual vs predicted values
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
plt.plot(train_data.index, train_data, label='Train')
plt.plot(test_data.index, test_data, label='Test')
plt.plot(predictions.predicted_mean.index, predictions.predicted_mean, label='Predicted')
plt.fill_between(predictions_ci.index, predictions_ci.iloc[:, 0], predictions_ci.iloc[:, 1], color='k', alpha=0.2)
plt.title('SARIMA Model - Actual vs. Predicted')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Number of Transactions')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Model Summary
model_summary = model_fit.summary()

model_summary
````

The final step in our analysis is to build an econometric model. Given the stable trend and evident seasonality, we might consider models that can capture these elements, such as SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). This model is well-suited for data with seasonality and can help in forecasting future transaction trends.

SARIMA Model: Actual vs. Predicted

The SARIMA model has been fitted to the daily transactions data, and its predictions are compared with the actual values.

Model Overview:

•	Model Parameters: The SARIMA model used parameters (1, 1, 1) for the non-seasonal part and (1, 1, 1, 30) for the seasonal part.

•	Train and Test Data: The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's predictive performance.

•	Predictions: The model's predictions for the test set are plotted against the actual values.

Observations from the Plot:

•	The model captures the general pattern and seasonality of the transactions.

•	There's a reasonable alignment between the predicted and actual values, indicating the model's effectiveness in forecasting the number of transactions.

Model Summary:

•	The coefficients of the model and their significance (P>|z|) are detailed in the summary.

•	The Ljung-Box test and other diagnostic measures suggest the model fits the data reasonably well.
